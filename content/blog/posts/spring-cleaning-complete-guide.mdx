Spring has arrived in Central Florida, and with it comes the perfect opportunity to refresh your home after the cooler months. As professional cleaners serving Oviedo, Winter Park, and the greater Orlando area, we've seen firsthand how Florida's unique climate presents both opportunities and challenges for spring cleaning.

## Why Spring Cleaning Matters in Florida

Unlike northern climates where spring cleaning traditionally meant opening windows after a long winter, Florida's spring cleaning focuses on different priorities:

- **Allergen removal** from oak pollen and other seasonal irritants
- **Humidity control** preparation for the upcoming summer months  
- **Deep cleaning** before spending more time indoors during peak summer heat

Start your spring cleaning during the first cool front in March when humidity levels are lower and you can open windows for better ventilation.

## Room-by-Room Spring Cleaning Checklist

### Living Areas
1. **Dust ceiling fans** - Essential before switching from heat to A/C
2. **Clean air vents and replace filters** - Crucial for allergen control
3. **Deep clean upholstery** - Remove accumulated dust and pet dander
4. **Wash windows inside and out** - Take advantage of lower humidity

### Kitchen Deep Clean
Our team recommends focusing on these often-overlooked areas:

- Behind and under appliances
- Inside the refrigerator and freezer
- Pantry organization and expiration date checks
- Cabinet fronts and handles (they collect more grime in humid weather)

The key to effective spring cleaning in Florida is working systematically and taking advantage of those precious low-humidity days. Don't try to do everything in one weekend!

### Bedrooms and Bathrooms

**Bedrooms:**
- Rotate mattresses and wash all bedding in hot water
- Clean out closets and donate items you didn't wear this winter
- Dust baseboards and window sills thoroughly

**Bathrooms:**
- Deep clean grout and caulking (Florida humidity can encourage mold growth)
- Replace old shower curtains or deep clean glass doors
- Organize medicine cabinets and dispose of expired items

## Pro Tips for Success

### Timing Is Everything
- **Best days:** Cool, dry days with low humidity (typically early morning)
- **Avoid:** Rainy days or when pollen counts are high
- **Plan:** Break tasks into manageable chunks over 2-3 weekends

### Essential Supplies for Florida Homes
- Microfiber cloths (they work better in humid conditions)
- Dehumidifier for basement/storage areas
- Enzyme cleaners for pet accidents (more effective in humid climates)
- Quality air purifiers with HEPA filters

## When to Call the Professionals

While DIY spring cleaning is rewarding, some tasks are better left to professionals:

- **Deep carpet cleaning** - Especially important for allergen removal
- **Pressure washing** exterior surfaces
- **Air duct cleaning** - Crucial for Florida homes with year-round A/C use
- **Deep kitchen cleaning** - Including inside ovens, range hoods, and behind appliances

Once you've completed your spring cleaning, maintain that fresh feeling with these weekly habits:

2. **Dust surfaces twice weekly** when pollen is high
3. **Run dehumidifiers** in problem areas
4. **Schedule quarterly deep cleans** to stay ahead of Florida's year-round allergens
